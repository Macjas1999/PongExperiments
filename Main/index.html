        <p><strong>About me:</strong><br>
        For a long time, my interests have been focused on technology, applications of IT solutions and first and foremost, understanding their operation.<br> In addition to software issues, I am very interested in hardware and low-level issues such as programming microcontrollers such as Arduino.<br>
        I studied for a year and a half at the University of Adam Mickiewicz in Poznań in the field of Computer Science. In the near future, she plans to get an engineering degree, completing the above-mentioned course. I believe that the time spent at the university has provided me with solid foundations and tools, as well as confirmed my willingness to pursue development
        towards broadly understood IT.<br>
        Programming and learning about new technologies is currently a hobby for me, which I would also like to make a source of income.<br>Currently, I work on the hotline and e-mail service of the OBI DIY store, but I would like to develop in the direction closer to my interests. I am looking for a suitable place in the industry and I do not have a strict specialization, so I am ready to learn any system, language, framework or work paradigm.</p>
